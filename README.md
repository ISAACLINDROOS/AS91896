# Isaac Lindroos: AS91896
### Use advanced programming techniques to develop a computer program (Level 2, 6 credits)

#### Task:
Create a program that works as a tool to allow users to solve a specific problem.  

#### Problem: 
Parents and students would like a Budget Laptop Calculator to assist them in figuring out the prices of a laptop that is fit for purpose at school. For example, the student needs his laptop for 3d modelling, must have a minimum RAM of 16GB, this tool would suggest possible laptops and a predicted budget.

You need to think about the context this calculator would be used in, the end users and the usability of such a tool and plan accordingly. You are encouraged to refine and redesign your calculator interface based on your own goals.  

#### Your task is to create a functional prototype to suit the needs of your potential users. You may create a text-based program or a GUI interface (which will require a library like tkinter or PyQt5).

# How to use the Laptop Price Calculator

This laptop calculator is designed to help people through the sometimes complicated and overwhelming process of selecting a new laptop.

#### A few things to note:
* This application is a work in progress and is constantly being updated, The best way to stay up-to-date with the latest version is to check for the latest release in [Releases](https://github.com/ISAACLINDROOS/AS91896/tree/main/Releases).
* This application runs off the x64 processor (CPU) architecture. This means the app supports only Intel processors and needs Rosetta to work on a Mac with Apple silicon.


> #### On Mac computers with Apple silicon, About This Mac shows an item labelled Chip, followed by the name of the chip:

Install the App by saving the latest file in the [Releases](https://github.com/ISAACLINDROOS/AS91896/tree/main/Releases) directory or select from the releases side menu. Once the file has been downloaded, run the .exe file (If done correctly, the main window should open).

> #### On Mac computers with Apple silicon, you may need to install Rosetta. A window like the one below may pop-up, simply click "Install" to continue.

When the Main window opens, Simply go step by step through the process of selecting each option until complete. When ready, hit the "Generate" button (This will open a new window with your results). 

You can also download your results as a PDF Export by clicking the "Download" button on the results window.
