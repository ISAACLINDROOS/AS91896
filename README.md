### Use advanced programming techniques to develop a computer program (Level 2, 6 credits)

#### Task:
Create a program that works as a tool to allow users to solve a specific problem.  

#### Problem: 
Parents and students would like a Budget Laptop Calculator to assist them in figuring out the prices of a laptop that is fit for purpose at school. For example, the student needs his laptop for 3d modelling, must have a minimum RAM of 16GB, this tool would suggest possible laptops and a predicted budget.

You need to think about the context this calculator would be used in, the end users and the usability of such a tool and plan accordingly. You are encouraged to refine and redesign your calculator interface based on your own goals.  

#### Your task is to create a functional prototype to suit the needs of your potential users. You may create a text-based program or a GUI interface (which will require a library like tkinter or PyQt5).

# Prerequisites
To successfully run this program, you need to first setup your Python development environment. Specifically, this program requires:

## Software & Extensions:
* VS Code
* The VS Code Python extension
* Python 3 or later

## Environments:

* `pip`	

The Python package manager that installs and updates packages. It's installed with Python 3.9+ by default (install python3-pip on Debian-based OSs).

* `venv`

Allows you to manage separate package installations for different projects and is installed with Python 3 by default (install python3-venv if you are using a Debian-based OS)

* `conda`	

Installed with Anaconda and Miniconda. It can be used to manage both packages and virtual environments. Generally used for data science projects.

### Create a virtual environment

To create a virtual environment, use the following command, where ".venv" is the name of the environment folder:

```shell
# macOS/Linux
# You may need to run sudo apt-get install python3-venv first
python3 -m venv .venv

# Windows
# You can also use py -3 -m venv .venv
python -m venv .venv

```
>Note: To learn more about the `venv` module, see Creation of virtual environments at https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html

When you create a new virtual environment, a prompt will be displayed to allow you to select it for the workspace.

This will add the path to the Python interpreter from the new virtual environment to your workspace settings. That environment will then be used when installing packages and running code through the Python extension.
